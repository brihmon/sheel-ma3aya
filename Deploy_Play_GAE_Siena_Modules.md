how to deploy

http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/java/gettingstarted/uploading.html

Uploading Using the Command Prompt
You can upload your application code and files using a command included in the SDK named appcfg.cmd (Windows) or appcfg.sh (Mac OS X, Linux).
AppCfg is a multi-purpose tool for interacting with your app on App Engine. The command takes the name of an action, the path to your app's war/ directory, and other options. To upload the app code and files to App Engine, you use the update action.
To upload the app, using Windows:
..\appengine-java-sdk\bin\appcfg.cmd update war
To upload the app, using Mac OS X or Linux:
../appengine-java-sdk/bin/appcfg.sh update war
